Car Sharing App:  The Car Sharing Service App is a car rental platform that utilizes JWT authorization to ensure secure access. The user base is categorized into managers and clients, providing differentiated access rights within the app. The application employs a Telegram bot to send notifications to users when a rental has been initiated, paid for, or expired. These notifications can be customized by the application administrator. The payment system is powered by the Stripe API, ensuring secure transactions. In case of any errors, the transaction is automatically canceled.
